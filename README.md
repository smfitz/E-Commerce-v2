### The purpose of this assignment was to create an Back-End Express.js application that used Object Relational Mapping and Sequelize to connect to a SQL Database.
#### Users can use CRUD operations to manage their databse of inventory. 

#### To use this Application please clone or fork the code from GitHub. When downloaded and opened on your local system, make sure to use Environmental Varibles to access the SQL database. To start the server make sure you have all dependincies installed using "npm i" and then after navigating to the server.js file, simply type "node server". The server will be live and you can now make changes and additions to the datebase through an application like insomnia or postman. 

#### Here is a video demonstrating the functionality of this application: https://app.castify.com/view/5a634a9d-2fd0-47dd-8b8e-05b3b94984ad
